makes the auction house easier to use, by presenting auction house listings
clearly and succinctly, and by eliminating the tedium involved in posting and
managing auctions.

  item is that you just picked up
* Adds the Shopping tab to search and filter for multiple items at once
* Adds the Selling tab which lets you buy, sell and cancel all in one place
* And adds the Cancelling tab that lets you cancel auctions in one click and
scan for undercuts.
